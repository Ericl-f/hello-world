Hi Eric!

Today is February 28,2021,cloudy.And it's my first times use GitHub.Maybe 
it is a very hard project for me,because there is no any Chinese word on this Web site.I try to use translation software to help me,but the content it gives me is not what I want.So I have tried lots of methods to improve my English level.any way,after all,that a good begining,so just fighting!Eric.
